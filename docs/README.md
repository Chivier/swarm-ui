## About SwarmX-UI

SwarmX-UI is a low-code workflow orchestration platform that serves as the visual frontend and client-side runtime for the SwarmX distributed computing system. It provides:

- **Visual Workflow Editor**: n8n-style drag-and-drop interface for building computational DAGs
- **Client-Side Orchestrator**: Manages workflow execution state, scheduling decisions, and fault tolerance
- **Data Plane Coordination**: Implements PGAS-style data reference system (DataRef) for efficient large-scale data handling
